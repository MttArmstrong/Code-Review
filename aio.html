</h3>
<p><strong><em>Who</em></strong> is performing the review and whose work
is being reviewed determines the point of a review. If a senior member
is reviewing a pull request from an intern, they may want to provide
feedback on style or help the intern understand the larger software
system. Conversely, an intern may share a new language feature they just
learned in college that the senior developer hadn’t known. Maybe a
stakeholder is reviewing user stories to ensure the deliverable will
satisfy their needs. The desired audience will affect how a review is
performed, what kind of common language is available to a senior
developer that a stakeholder may not understand?</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what">What<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>What</em></strong> is being reviewed can also change what
the collaborative construction is called. When reviewing single lines of
code as they are written, this is usually called pair programming.
Reviewing single PRs or commits is classified as code review. You can
also review design documents in project planning. Checking test coverage
may be called quality assurance and a final check of a repository prior
to release is a repository review. <img src="fig/1.what.svg" alt="What is being reviewed" width="1000" class="figure"></p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="when">When<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#when"></a>

<p><strong><em>When</em></strong> a review takes place is tightly
coupled to what is being reviewed, but not entirely. Consider discussing
a change to the underlying data structure in a program. Such a
recommendation could be easily considered during design but may be
impractical prior to release (especially if the code isn’t modular).
Keep in mind where in the project life cycle a review takes place. <img src="fig/1.when.svg" alt="When it is reviewed" width="600" class="figure"></p>

<h3 id="why">Why<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>Why</em></strong> a review happens can be for a variety
of reasons. Maybe they are a rubber stamp you have to do before anything
is merged. Maybe you really don’t know the best algorithm or library for
an operation and want feedback from a colleague. Or perhaps you are a
new contributor to a project and want to learn more about the
fundamental systems in place. Usually code reviews take place to ensure
changes to code are necessary and correct. An hour spent by a separate
developer can save days or weeks of time tracking down a new bug or
failing test. This is why large companies require reviews, but reviews
can be beneficial to smaller teams that also contain novice developers.
Some other benefits for reviewers can include: - Identifying bugs that
the developer may have overlooked - Gauging how well the code satisfies
requirements - Suggesting better designs, refactorings, or other
improvements - Verifying that the code has sufficient
test-automation</p>

<h3 id="pair-programming-and-code-review">Pair Programming and Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pair-programming-and-code-review"></a>
</h3>
<p>With such a vast range of possible topics, we will focus here on Pair
Programming and Code Review at the level of a PR. Pair programming is
working together, simultaneously with one person typing and the other
providing guidance and feedback. Code Reviews of PRs are usually
asynchronous and performed to ensure incoming code has a specific
purpose and meets quality standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="mechanics-and-methods">Mechanics and Methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mechanics-and-methods"></a>
</h2>
<p>Code review requires two complementary skills: the mechanical actions
of performing the review through github (or another version control
system) and the soft skills of providing feedback.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to draw a comparison between code review and
editing a scientific paper. The mechanics of editing a paper may require
learning how to record changes, add comments or adjust references. What
you say in those comments and what changes you suggest are part of the
soft skills. Perhaps even more important is how you say it.</p>
<p>With software, we sometimes lose sight that there is no right or best
answer. For any problem that is non-trivial, multiple solutions are
viable and the choice between them requires balancing different trade
offs often based on personal experience. There are many build systems
for python. You may have a preference based on good or bad experiences
you had in a prior project, but that doesn’t make it the correct
decision. Again relating to editing a manuscript, you (probably) won’t
say something like “you picked the wrong colors in this graph” or “you
used this phrase incorrectly”. Even, in cases where factual errors are
present, it’s more polite to focus on the writing instead of the writer.
Recommendations provided with respect are more likely to be followed or
at least considered.</p>
<p>What you decide to bring up in a review is personal, reflecting your
background knowledge, project goals, and even your mood during the
review. We can’t cover all possible things to review, just think of it
as an exercise in copy-editing. You have some knowledge that will help
the code get better and you need to share that in a way that will be
received positively. We will have some details and guidance later, but
try to approach reviews like you would prose, not a mechanical drawing
or mathematical proof.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="developers-are-people-too">Developers are People Too<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#developers-are-people-too"></a>
</h2>
<p>While you are writing code, you are ultimately producing instructions
for the machine. You can be terse and uncaring because machines don’t
have feelings. While you are writing reviews, you are providing feedback
to a person. Remember they don’t know everything you do (and vice versa)
and that doesn’t reflect on their value as a person, their intelligence
or even their capabilities. Maybe a PR was made to meet a deadline and
there wasn’t time to go back and refactor. Perhaps you have a decade of
experience with python while they picked it up a year ago and are more
comfortable with compiled languages. Maybe they are also handling a sick
family member at home and are having trouble focusing. So before
starting a review, remember to change your audience from computer to
people.</p>
<p>Practically, follow these suggestions: - Criticize the code, not the
coder. In general, avoid using “you”. Replace phrases like “you should
have …” with “we should consider …”. In the latter version you are
taking partial ownership (we) and providing a suggestion instead of a
command. You can remove the subject entirely: “Consider …” or make a
question “What about …”. In any case, you change focus from the actor,
“you”, to the action. - Be polite. Instead of saying “It’s stupid to use
this algorithm” give the reasons why an alternative would be better
“When the sample size is above X, it would be more memory efficient to
do Y.” - Let a style guide (or formatter) dictate style. There are no
reasons to argue over line wrapping or tab stops. Decide on these early,
setup CI and precommit to enforce them and spend your time doing more
important things. - Give code examples, with context. Instead of saying
“Use f-strings” provide a snippet of how the code will look. But also
don’t just highlight the region and give the code! Remember sharing
knowledge is an important part of reviews. Explain that f-strings are
generally faster and easier to read. As a reviewee, don’t just accept
code snippets. Make sure you understand what the new code does and why
it may be a better option. This may require some independent research. -
Give feedback, not commands. All of your feedback is optional and it’s
helpful to the reviewee to have reviews written as such. Instead of
“Rename this class to X” say “Can we rename this class to X? I think
it…”. In the dialog that follows, the reviewee can say “No, because of
…” or “Of course, that’s a great point.” You give them the option to say
no without being confrontational. - Give praise. Reviews aren’t just
about mistakes and nitpicks. If you see a clever algorithm or clean
refactoring, say it! For teams you work with continually, recognize
signs of improvement. - Make code better, not perfect. Highlighting and
fixing a few issues is better than totally rewriting a PR and crushing a
junior developers confidence. - Recognize stalemates. You don’t have to
win every battle and reviewees don’t have to accept every
recommendation. If you feel like a conversation is getting personal and
no longer constructive, reach out to a third party for help or agree to
disagree.</p>

</h2>
<p>Collaborative Construction is a heterogeneous topic that is important
throughout project lifetimes and has many different goals. The mechanics
of reviews are separate from what to review. Think of code reviews like
editing a manuscript to get into the right frame of mind and always
remember the other developer is a person. Your relationship may last
several years or just this PR, but they deserve respect and
recognition.</p>
<p>In this module, we will cover pair programming and code review at the
PR level. While pair programming is less often utilized, it allows you
to experience providing guidance and feedback to a fellow developer
without getting caught up with the mechanics of performing a review.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-pair-programming">Introduction to Pair Programming<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction-to-pair-programming"></a>
</h1>
<p><strong>Pair programming</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>pairing</strong>)
is an increasingly popular technique used in software development. It
addresses the “high cost, low payback” feeling of being a code reviewer
by having two developers work together actively, to write a feature and
its tests.</p>
<p>When pair programming, there are two roles: * The Driver - the one
who actually controls the keyboard and the mouse, and writes the code
while talking/describing their approach, asking questions about
potential issues or confusing details. * This is described as
“programming out loud” * The Navigator - observes what the driver is
doing, asking/answering questions, evaluating the work, pointing out
potential pitfalls, etc.</p>
<p>Periodically, at reasonable points, the Driver and Navigator switch
roles.</p>
<p>It is true that pair programming takes more time to write a given
programming. However, “two people doing the work of one person” is a
completely wrong assessment. Several studies have shown only a ~15%
increase to development time with pairing, after participants became
comfortable with the approach. But, if pairing saves sufficient costs in
other parts of the development lifecycle (e.g. debugging, maintenance)
then it is worth it.</p>
<p>As with code reviews, there are several significant benefits of pair
programming that <em>far outweigh</em> this increase in development
time, which we will talk about next.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="pair-programming-and-defects">Pair Programming and Defects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pair-programming-and-defects"></a>
</h2>
<p>Pair programming does an excellent job of improving code quality,
with one study showing that pair-programming produced code with 15%
fewer defects than solo-programming.</p>
<p>This is typically because: * Two people tend to do much better
considering all possible execution scenarios than one person does. * A
single implementer can become hyper-focused on a specific part of the
implementation, losing detail on the “big picture” * Two people can
validate an implementation against requirements more effectively. *
Motivating all parts of the implementation against all requirements *
Variances in understanding of a requirement will also be identified
through discussing the requirement * “Rubber-duck debugging” is
incorporated into the process</p>
<div id="what-is-rubber-duck-debugging" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-is-rubber-duck-debugging" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What is Rubber-duck debugging?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Originating from a story in the 1999 book, The Pragmatic Programmer,
“rubber-ducking” is the act of describing code line-by-line to
something, sentient or otherwise (a rubber duck in the original story),
while debugging code. While it may sound ridiculous, this phenomena has
been found to increase the detection of bugs or unintended behavior.
While pair-programming, the driver will explain the code line by line
while substituting the rubber-duck for the navigator, experiencing a
similar effect. <img src="fig/2.duck.svg" alt="Duck" width="800" class="figure"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Assuming that pair programming is generally this effective, the
time-savings in future debugging and maintenance costs more than
compensates for the slight increase in development costs.</p>
<p>Remember, the longer a defect is undetected, the more costly it is to
fix. Pair-programming tends to detect and resolve defects at the
earliest possible moment, before code is even included in a commit to a
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="improved-satisfaction-and-team-dynamics">Improved Satisfaction and Team Dynamics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#improved-satisfaction-and-team-dynamics"></a>
</h2>
<p>Pair programming has been found to dramatically increase individual
satisfaction. Collaborating with someone on a shared task is far more
enjoyable for most people, and allows for the pair to celebrate success,
mourn setbacks, and generally build camaraderie. One study consistently
showed &gt;90% of participants preferred pair programming over solo
programming (Williams 2000).</p>
<p>Another added benefit of pair-programming is that team members learn
to work with each other more effectively. By giving consistent practice
in this area, pair programming forces people to work through personality
differences and different working styles.</p>
<p>Pair programming also supports the distribution of knowledge and
skills more broadly throughout the team. By pairing junior and senior
developers together, opportunities for mentorship are created. Including
teammates who are unfamiliar with a part of the code will teach them how
it works, and broaden the shared knowledge throughout the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="improved-productivity">Improved Productivity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#improved-productivity"></a>
</h2>
<p>Teams that practice pair-programming frequently report increased
productivity. Switching regularly between the Driver and Navigator roles
keeps developers fresher and more engaged throughout the day.</p>
<p>For example, if one developer is distracted by some external
interruption, the other person can get them back up to speed on the task
more quickly.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t utilize pair programming daily, it can be a nice
break from solo programming and even a little fun! Pair programming is
especially useful in events like hackathons, where there may be more
people than action items to do. Everyone will contribute to the project
without stepping on toes and keeps the team fresh and motivated by
swapping roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="issues-with-pair-programming">Issues with Pair Programming<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#issues-with-pair-programming"></a>
</h2>
<p>Pair programming requires active focus, communication and
participation from both programmers. Long periods of silence is a
warning sign of something wrong.</p>
<p>Pair programming simply won’t work well if: * Either participant
isn’t focused on the task at hand * Either participant isn’t making an
effort to engage in ongoing communication about the task at hand</p>
<p>Other practices to avoid (in a larger team setting): * The same pairs
of developers always working together, or developers never work on areas
they are unfamiliar with * This inhibits knowledge-sharing benefits *
The participants have unresolvable personality conflicts * This is rare,
but it happens</p>
<p>Also remember, that pair-programming is not a fix-all solution. Not
every part of a program warrants pairing. For example, two experts
working on simple, well-understood tasks will likely work faster
individually than if they are pairing. Pairing achieves the greatest
benefits when: * The task is complex and/or difficult to implement
correctly * The programmers are unfamiliar with the problem being
solved</p>
<p>Senior developers should also pair with junior developers in order to
provide mentoring. It is important for the senior developer to be
patient and work at the junior developer’s pace and to solicit feedback
from the junior developer on their code.<br>

term plans, focus on details the Driver doesn’t have the bandwidth to
consider, and can tell the Driver if they didn’t notice a speed limit
change. As the Driver gets tired the two people swap jobs so they can
keep moving</p>
<p>You may have experienced car trips where the roles were less defined
and the Navigator was back seat driving. Yelling at the Driver that they
need to slow down because there is a police car up ahead can make
everyone stressed. As the Driver, you can’t just ignore the Navigator
and go your own way. You need to work together to quickly, and safely
arrive at your destination.</p>

(e.g. 240%) * Avoid changing the perceived color of the image * To limit

<hr class="half-width">
<p><strong>Code reviews</strong>, or <strong>peer (code)
reviews</strong> are a practice where someone other than the code’s
author reads and reviews the code. The author is often involved in the
review, and answers any questions that the reviewer has.</p>
<p>These are sometimes <em>formal inspections</em> of a portion of the
code and may be part of an acceptance process that the project requires
(e.g. for safety-critical software). Code reviews tend to be a more
heavy-weight process with specific criteria to evaluate.</p>
<p>More commonly, code-reviews are <em>change-based</em> code reviews,
e.g. “Every new feature or bug-fix must be reviewed before it is
incorporated into the main-line of development.”</p>
<p>This is the process that is adopted by most large software companies,
and tends to be lighter-weight, akin to a “<strong>code
walk-through</strong>” or “<strong>read-through</strong>.”</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="benefits-of-code-reviews">Benefits of Code Reviews<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#benefits-of-code-reviews"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Benefits of formalized code reviews (inspections) are very well
documented.</p>
<p>From Code Complete, 2ed. pp.480-481</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM found that each hour of inspection prevented about 100 hours of
related work (testing and defect correction) (Holland 1999)</li>
<li>Hewlett-Packard reported that its inspection program saved an
estimated $21.5 million per year (Grady and Van Slack 1994)</li>
<li>A study of large programs found that each hour spent on inspections
avoided an average of 33 hours of maintenance work and that inspections
were up to 20 times more efficient than testing (Russell 1991)</li>
<li>A group of 11 programs were developed by the same group of people,
and all were released to production. The first five were developed
without reviews and averaged 4.5 errors per 100 lines of code. The other
six were inspected and averaged only 0.82 errors per 100 lines of code.
Reviews cut the errors by over 80% (Freedman and Weinberg 1990).</li>
<li>[<em>and many many more…</em>]</li>
</ul>
<p>While less-formal code walk-throughs/read-throughs vary much more
widely in their benefits, they can still achieve many of the
knowledge-sharing, team-building and defect-detection benefits, but not
as reliably as formal reviews.</p>
<p>The main differences are: * The code’s author tends to lead the
walk-through, as opposed to a separate moderator in an inspection.
Read-throughs are self-driven by the reviewer. * Reviewers are varied in
their commitment to providing a thorough and detailed assessment of the
code. * Defects in the code may or may not be formally recorded as
action-items to address, with a follow-up to see if they have been
corrected</p>
<p>Taking care not to lose the rigor of the review process is essential
to achieving all the benefits to be had. As usual with life, you get out
of it what you put into it.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="challenges-of-code-reviews">Challenges of Code Reviews<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#challenges-of-code-reviews"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>From discussions with other RSEs, there is a realization that code
reviews are beneficial but difficult to implement. Maybe you are sold
and want to start adding code reviews to your PRs. You are able and
willing to review, but you need someone else to review your code! If you
work in a small (perhaps solo) development team, who will review your
code and how can you help them get started?</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="i-work-alone-or-with-researchersnovice-developers">I work alone or with researchers/novice developers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#i-work-alone-or-with-researchersnovice-developers"></a>
</h3>
<p>There is a certain asymmetry with code reviews when you are the
expert and decide to add in code reviews. You can review PRs from others
but not your own work! It seems intractable to tell someone else, hey
you have to look at my code and catch all the bugs.</p>
<p>However, you don’t <em>need</em> someone else to review your code,
you can perform self reviews. Similar to copy editing, you (hopefully)
look over your own writing before submitting it for grading or your PI.
Self reviews are usually not better than peer reviews, but are vastly
better than nothing. For best results, let the PR sit for a day or two
before performing your review. That will give you fresh eyes.</p>
<p>Also, don’t underestimate novice developers or even non coders to
review code. If you have a stakeholder that’s willing to click a few
buttons on github, they may catch logical or domain specific errors. You
should strive to have your code readable enough that a novice can follow
the algorithm!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="i-struggle-with-all-the-tools">I struggle with all the tools!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#i-struggle-with-all-the-tools"></a>
</h3>
<p>Remember the separation of mechanics and methods. The method of code
review is the act of critically evaluating a section of code and
providing feedback in a courteous way. We have some practice doing this
with pair programming. Here we will dig into the mechanics: what are you
reviewing and where do you write your comments. The practice of
evaluating code is much more difficult than knowing which buttons to
press on github!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="my-project-requires-a-lot-of-domain-knowledge-i-dont-think-anyone-else-can-give-me-feedback">My project requires a lot of domain knowledge, I don’t think anyone
else can give me feedback<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#my-project-requires-a-lot-of-domain-knowledge-i-dont-think-anyone-else-can-give-me-feedback"></a>
</h3>
<p>Even if someone doesn’t understand every line of your code, they can
still provide a different view of the code. Maybe your variable names
are unintelligible to someone without your domain knowledge and they
don’t have to be. Maybe you forgot to include a license or your
functions are too long or complex. None of these require deep knowledge
of your domain and can be helpful.</p>
<p>Also note that if your code can’t be understood by anyone but you, it
may require some refactoring to improve readability. Open source
software has to be approachable to would-be contributors. A non-expert
reviewer can help identify places a general developer will have trouble
following.</p>

<p>It can be tempting to set lofty goals for code reviews, but in
reality, people just can’t concentrate too deeply or for too long!</p>
<p>Widely-recommended practices are to: * Make small PRs which are
easier to review. * Have a checklist covering what a PR should contain
and accomplish * Limit code reviews to 60 minutes or less * Review
<strong>at most</strong> 500 lines of code per hour</p>
<p>Reviewing more code than recommended here can lead to fatigue and the
temptation to just say “looks good to me”. Code review requires
concentrated, thoughtful feedback.</p>

<p>Reviewers should have a clear sense of what feedback is being
solicited. Some companies have general guidelines for what
code-reviewers should be looking for in the code they review</p>
<p>If you are seeking specific kinds of feedback, communicate that to
your reviewers! In the absence of this, projects should include general
code-review goals and guidelines for reviewers to reference</p>
<p>If there is other background knowledge necessary for an effective
code-review, provide it to the reviewers. This can be included or

users? * <strong>Tests</strong>: Does the code have correct and
well-designed automated tests? * <strong>Naming</strong>: Did developer
choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.? *

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The highest priority should be placed on providing courteous and
respectful feedback on another person’s work. This is a critical skill
to develop, and should never be compromised, even in jest.</p>
<p>When providing feedback: * Use objective, constructive, neutral
language * Critique the code, not the programmer * Avoid theatrics and
absolute judgments, like “This is the worst code I’ve ever seen!” “I
have no idea how this ever worked in the first place.” * Ask questions
and seek understanding, rather than rendering judgment * The author has
thought about the problem a lot more than you have, and they may have
reasons for what they did – even if it’s still misguided in the end *
Explain your concerns clearly and completely * Try to explain your
reasoning for issues you point out, e.g. inputs that would trigger
undesirable behavior, alternate approaches that may be more efficient,
etc.</p>
<p>Programmers are often highly opinionated. Creating software feels
personal; you are problem solving and translating that in the best way
you can. Receiving criticism can seem like someone challenging how you
think! Remember, that there are many good ways to solve any given
problem – including ways that you personally wouldn’t use: different
ways of naming variables, writing loops, structuring functions, etc.
When providing feedback, indicate whether your feedback is about a
serious issue (e.g. correctness, security, safety), versus merely you
expressing an opinion or suggestion.</p>

<p>Some goals of code reviews are to check coding style, and to identify
bugs, anti-patterns and language abuses. The good news is that there are
<em>static analysis tools</em> to help supplement the code-review
process and remove some of the more laborious tasks such as: * Verify
(or apply) the team’s coding standards * Flag common bugs and language
anti-patterns</p>
<p>These tools eliminate a whole range of issues that would otherwise
need to be addressed in the code review. Where possible, codify your
project style and set up CI/CD or precommit to automatically check or
correct any issues prior to code review. These are similar to using a
built-in spell checker, you don’t want to waste time looking up spelling
in a dictionary! Static analysis tools allow the review to focus on
higher-level concerns - how the code works, how it benefits the project,
higher-level structural/design issues, etc.</p>

<p>You don’t have to perform code reviews in github, but they are nicely
integrated and widely used so it is helpful to practice there. Ideally,
your project would develop in the following cycle: <img src="fig/6.git_workflow.svg" alt="Git Workflow" width="1000" class="figure"> 1. A
user requests a feature or notices a bug. They open an
<strong>issue</strong>. Each issue should contain a single problem or
feature and be self contained. 2. A developer works on the issue,
implementing the feature or fixing the bug. The submit a <strong>pull
request</strong> consisting of (possibly several) small commits. Commits
should be atomic, e.g. can be selected and applied in any order. 3. A
maintainer or other developer <strong>reviews</strong> the pull request.
They should ensure the PR addresses the issue (and only the issue) while
maintaining a high quality of code in the project.</p>
<p>Obviously, life would be easy if this were always true. If you are
the only developer you would have to perform all these operations. As
you implement a feature, maybe you decide to refactor a method at the
same time. When you are rushed, you may be tempted to merge a PR
immediately, foregoing the review. Try to resist these urges, especially
as you are forming your code review habit.</p>
<p>You can also review code outside of github. Maybe a coworker calls
you over and you look at a function implementation on their screen and
give some quick feedback. Or you edit an answer on stack overflow to
improve it. Maybe a collaborator emails a notebook and you recommend
some functions to reduce duplication in their cells. These are all
valuable and good practice of the method of critically reviewing other
people’s code. However, here we will focus on the mechanics of providing
feedback on a PR in github.</p>
<p>We will be using the excellent practice materials from <a href="code-review.org">code-review.org</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://code-review.org/docs/setup/setup/" class="external-link">Setup the
tutorial</a> on github. Create the text and python exercises.</li>
<li>Look over the issue for “text: Exercise 1” and the corresponding
recipe.</li>
<li>Open the PR for “Exercise 1 text.”
<ul>
<li>What do you think of their commits? The recommended fixes? Anything
to add or change?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on the “files changed” tab and start a review</li>
<li>When you have finished your review, swap reviews with someone else
and review their reviews! Focus on the content, tone and helpfulness.
Discuss what you liked or they could have done better.</li>
<li>Repeat the above with python Exercise 1.
<ul>
<li>Now you can focus on code quality a bit more. Use what you’ve
learned here and in other modules to improve the PR.</li>
<li>Before you get carried away with recommendations, what are the ideal
next steps for recommending larger changes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Optional) if you have time, review another PR from the tutorial
repo, a PR from another participant, or a PR in a project you like.</li>

<p>Code review adds a social aspect to the typically solitary work of
development. Giving feedback to people can be challenging after working
on software for a while, remember to change your audience and mentality.
Receiving feedback can also be difficult; reviews can feel like they are
attacking how your think instead of how you code.</p>
<p>Still, code review greatly improves projects, saving time and money
in substantial amounts. When starting, remember that self reviews are
useful practice and can improve PRs prior to merging. Talking and
sharing your expertise can be fun!</p>
